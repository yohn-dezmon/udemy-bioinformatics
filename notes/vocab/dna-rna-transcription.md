# DNA, RNA, Transcription

- all RNA comes from DNA
- the process of going from DNA -> RNA is called `transcription`  
- the result of transcription is a single stranded RNA molecule that is complementary to the DNA template strand


# Types of RNA

mRNA: carries information from DNA to the ribosome, directs protein synthesis.  
tRNA: transports amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis 


# Translation 

- creating proteins from amino acids
- tRNA brings the appropriate amino acids to the ribosomes according to specific codons (three nucleotide sequences) in the mRNA
