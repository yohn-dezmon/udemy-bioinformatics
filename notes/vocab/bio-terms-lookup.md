Nucleotide:
- Phosphate group, 5-C sugar (pentose) group, and a nitrogenous base (ACTGU)

Purines:
- Adenine (A) and Guanine (G)

Pyrimidines:
- Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T) and Uracil (U)

Pentoses:
- 5-C sugar
- Deoxyribose (in DNA)
- Ribose (in RNA)

Chromosome: 
- long strand of DNA + proteins
- humans have 46 chromosomes in each cell
- they are arranged into 23 pairs
- each pair: one chromosome inherited from mother, and one from the father
- 22 of the pairs are autosomes
- there is one pair of sex chromosomes (XX for females and XY for males)

Chromatid:
- part of an individual chromosome
- it is half of the chromosome
- each half is called a sister chromatid
- sister chromatids are joined by the centromere
- a continuous DNA molecule

Chromatin:
- complex of DNA and proteins in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells
- responsible for packaing DNA into a small volume to fit into the nucleus
- protects the DNA structure
- regulates gene expression and DNA replication
- vs. Chromosomes: 
    - chromatin is less condensed. 
    - chromatin is present during most of the cell cycle
    - chromosomes are only present during the cell division portion of the cell cycle
    - chromatin allows for gene regulation, replication, and repair
    - chromosomes ensure accurate segregation of genetic material during cell division

Pair of chromosomes (in humans):
- homologous pair 
- sames genes at same loci, but may have different alleles 

Gene:
- segments of DNA that code for specific proteins or functions

Loci:
- location of a gene on a chromosome

Allele:
- different versions of the same gene!
- e.g. you may have one allele for eye color from your mom but another from your dad (heterozygous)



Mitosis:
- cell division
- results in two identical daughter cells
- growth, repair, maintenance in multicellular organisms

Meiosis:

-
