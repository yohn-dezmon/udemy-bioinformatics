# NCBI Databases 

NCBI Database:
- nucleotide sequences
- protein sequences
- gene expression data
- structural information 
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

GenBank:
- hosted by NCBI
- all publicly available nucleotide sequences
- on NCBI website, divided into "Gene", "Nucleotide" databases

PubMed:
- hosted by NCBI

BLAST:
- Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
- hosted by NCBI
- compare sequences against a vast db to find similarities and relationships


https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/:
- all databases tab
- PubMed, GenBank, BLAST


Retrieving an accession number from GenBank:
- go to GenBank db on the NCBI website
- use the search bar to find a specific gene or organism
- click on result to view the details of the sequence
- copy the accession number of the sequence 
- Locus tag can be considered an accession number
- Gene ID can be an accession number
- accession number exists at the level of protein and mRNA
    - this is in the General protein information (!!) within the Gene db page.
    - unique identifier for this protein within NCBI db.

Nucleotide > bzip1 > bzip arabidopsis
Gene > bzip arabidopsis > NP_199756.1 
Gene > bzip arabidopsis > NCBI Reference Sequences (RefSeq) > NP_199756.1 (link) > FASTA (link) >  


Now we can use BLAST to find a similar sequence to the accession number:
