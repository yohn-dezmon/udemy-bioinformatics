# Intro

- Genomics
- Proteomics 

Biological datasets:
- genetic sequences
- protein structures
- gene expression profiles

Biotechnology:
- Discovery of new drugs, the development of diagnostic tests, and optimization of agricultural practices.  

NCBI:
- National Center for Biotechnology Information
- main database used for bioinformatics

bioinformatics applications:
- personalized healthcare
- precision medicine
- therapeutic interventions tailored to individual genetic profiles :O 
- analyzing hereditary diseases
- disease causing genetic mutations
- population genetics

Bioinformatics for drug discovery and development:
- identify drug targets
- pinpoint specific molecules or pathways that could be targeted by new drugs to treat diseases.
- biomarkers for cancer

Designing new drugs:
- design drugs that are totally virtual
- predicts drugs interactions with biological targets
- enhance the efficiency of the drug development process

Pharmacogenomics companies.  

Comparative genomics:
- comparing genetic sequences and structures across different species
- gain insignts about the evolutionary relationships


**genetics vs. genomics**
- genetics studies individual genes and their roles on inheritance
- traits are passed from parents to offspring via genes
- genetic counseling 
- gene therapy 
- diagnosing genetic disorders 

Genomics:
- studying the entire genome of an organism
- all the genes within an organism
- the interaction of all the genes within an organism
- analyzing large sets of genetic data to understand complex biological systems
- genome sequencing
- evolutionary biology 

Genome Sequencing:
- determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism's genome at a single time

Sequencing:
- Sanger Sequencing: an older method for small-scale projects
- Next-Generation Sequencing: Illumina, Ion Torrect, Pyrosequencing
- Third-Generation Sequencing: PacBio and Oxford Nanopore

The sequences generated are short reads, that need to be assembled back into complete sequences. 
This requires:
- alignment: matching the short reads to a refereence genome or assemblin them de novo if no reference exists
- assembly: overlapping sequences are pieced together to reconstruct the original genome.

How many genes does a person have?
- 20,000 - 25,000 genes
- most genes are protein coding
- 19,000 --> 20,0000
- non-coding genes: not for proteins lol
    - genes for RNA molecules
    - ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, microRNA

polymorphism: 
- discontinuous genetic variation, resulting in differences within a species 

The regulation, expression, and interaction of genes is what determines their role in biology and medicine. 


Agricultural applicatoins:
- crop improvements
- disease resistance
- genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
- he has courses on how to do research in agriculture (!!)

Environmental Conservation:
- monitor and analyze biodiversity 
- climate change impacts
- ecosystem dynamics 

Some diseases result in there being different genetics sequences in the individual with the disease.  

Proteomics:
- bioinformatics is used for mass spectrometry data analysis
- characterize and identify proteins, protein modifications, and protein-protein interactions

Structural modeling:
- predicting 3D structures of proteins
- drugs that target specific protein structures

Genome sequencing:
- previously took a long time
- can now be done in days/hours
